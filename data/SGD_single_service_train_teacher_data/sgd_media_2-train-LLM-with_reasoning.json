This change in preference is a clear indication that the user's interest has shifted towards the Adventure genre.\n\n        Furthermore, when the system suggests Captain Marvel, Shazam! and the Poseidon Adventure, the user does not reject any of these options, which suggests that they are interested in the Adventure genre.\n\n        Therefore, based on the user's expressed preference for Adventure movies and their lack of rejection of Adventure movie suggestions, it is appropriate to select 'adventure' as the value for the slot <media-genre>.\n\n        This selection is further confirmed when the user confirms that they want to watch True Grit, an Adventure movie, without subtitles.\n\n        In summary, the selection of 'adventure' as the value for the slot <media-genre> is based on the user's explicit expression of interest in the Adventure genre and their acceptance of Adventure movie suggestions without rejection.",
