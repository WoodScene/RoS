The user has also confirmed that they want the car until Monday next week, which implies that the rental period starts on March 3rd. Therefore, the most appropriate value for the slot <rentalcars-start_date> is 'March 3rd'. This is further confirmed by the system's statement that it has made the reservation for the sedan from March 3rd, 2 pm until March 4th.
